    "#### Lexer Construction Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input: Token Specifications**\n",
    "- A list of regular expressions (RE) in priority order that define the patterns of tokens in a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output: Lexer**\n",
    "- A program that reads an input stream and breaks it up into tokens based on the specified regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert REs into NFAs:**\n",
    "   - Transform regular expressions into Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs).\n",
    "   - Each regular expression corresponds to an NFA that recognizes the language defined by that expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert NFAs to DFA:**\n",
    "   - Convert NFAs to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for efficiency.\n",
    "   - Create a DFA that accepts the same language as the original NFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert DFA into Transition Table:**\n",
    "   - Create a transition table that represents the DFA.\n",
    "   - The table indicates the next state for each combination of current state and input symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Lex/Flex Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lex/Flex** is a powerful tool for generating lexical analyzers automatically.\n",
    "- Lex programs describe the lexical analyzer to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of Lex Programs:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{% manifest constants %}\n",
    "declarations\n",
    "%%\n",
    "translation rules\n",
    "%%\n",
    "auxiliary functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Translation Rules:**\n",
    "- Each rule has the form: `Pattern { Action }`.\n",
    "- Patterns are regular expressions, and actions are code fragments, typically in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lex Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describes how Lex works in terms of token recognition.\n",
    "- Lex takes a set of regular expressions and corresponding actions to create a lexer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# <center><img src=\"pictures/lex-work.JPG\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regular Expression to NFA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Illustrates the process of converting a regular expression to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA).\n",
    "- Each construct in the regular expression corresponds to a state transition in the NFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regular Expressions (RE):\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a concise way to describe a set of strings. It consists of:\n",
    "- **Alphabet:** A set of symbols (characters).\n",
    "- **Operators:** Specify operations to combine and manipulate sets of strings.\n",
    "- **Special Symbols:** Representing operations like concatenation, union, and closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA):\n",
    "\n",
    "An NFA is a type of finite automaton that allows multiple transitions from a state on a given input symbol. It has states, transitions, and an initial and final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps to Convert RE to NFA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Cases:**\n",
    "   - **Empty String (ùúñ):** Create an NFA with two states (initial and final) and an ùúñ transition between them.\n",
    "   - **Single Symbol (a):** Create an NFA with two states, one initial and one final, with a transition labeled by the symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concatenation (AB):**\n",
    "   - If RE is AB, create NFAs for A and B.\n",
    "   - Connect the final state of A to the initial state of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Union (A | B):**\n",
    "   - If RE is A | B, create NFAs for A and B.\n",
    "   - Create a new initial state with ùúñ transitions to the initial states of A and B.\n",
    "   - Create a new final state with ùúñ transitions from the final states of A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kleene Closure (A*):**\n",
    "   - If RE is A*, create an NFA for A.\n",
    "   - Add a new initial state with ùúñ transitions to the initial state of A and a ùúñ transition from the final state of A to the initial state of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's convert the regular expression `(a|b)*abb` to an NFA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Cases:**\n",
    "   - `a`: NFA1 (States: 2, Initial: 1, Final: 2, Transition: 1->2 (a))\n",
    "   - `b`: NFA2 (States: 2, Initial: 1, Final: 2, Transition: 1->2 (b))\n",
    "   - ùúñ: NFAùúñ (States: 2, Initial: 1, Final: 2, Transition: 1->2 (ùúñ))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concatenation (ab):**\n",
    "   - Concatenate NFA1 and NFA2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Union (a|b):**\n",
    "   - Create a new initial state with ùúñ transitions to the initial states of NFA1 and NFA2.\n",
    "   - Create a new final state with ùúñ transitions from the final states of NFA1 and NFA2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kleene Closure ((a|b)*):**\n",
    "   - Add a new initial state with ùúñ transitions to the initial state of the union NFA.\n",
    "   - Add a ùúñ transition from the final state of the union NFA to its initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Concatenation with `abb`:**\n",
    "   - Concatenate the Kleene Closure NFA with the NFA for `abb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting NFA accepts the language described by the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Converting NFA to DFA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrates the algorithm to convert NFAs to DFAs.\n",
    "- Each set of possible states in the NFA becomes one state in the DFA, resulting in a more efficient representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DFA Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "- Two DFA states are equivalent if all subsequent behavior from those states is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure:**\n",
    "1. Create a table of state pairs.\n",
    "2. Mark cells where one state is final and the other is non-final.\n",
    "3. Mark pairs where transitions on the same symbol lead to marked pairs.\n",
    "4. Repeat step 3 until no unmarked pairs remain.\n",
    "5. Merge unmarked states to achieve a minimized DFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolving Ambiguities in Lexers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Expression Ambiguity:**\n",
    "- Ambiguity arises when regular expressions can match input in multiple ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conflict Resolution in Lex:**\n",
    "1. **Longest/Maximal Match Rule:**\n",
    "   - Prefer a longer prefix over a shorter one.\n",
    "2. **Declaration Priority:**\n",
    "   - If the longest prefix matches multiple patterns, prefer the one listed first in the Lex program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Flex Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "- An essential reference for using the Flex tool.\n",
    "- It provides detailed information on the Flex tool and its capabilities.\n",
    "- Refer to the provided appendix slide for in-depth insights.\n",
