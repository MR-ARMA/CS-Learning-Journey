    "### 1. Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is commonly used for string matching within a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- The regular expression `(a + b * c)*` describes the language of all strings over the alphabet `{a, b, c}` where any combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` is allowed, including the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations on Regular Expressions\n",
    "- **Concatenation (`r1 r2`):** Combines two regular expressions.\n",
    "- **Union (`r1 + r2`):** Represents alternatives between two regular expressions.\n",
    "- **Kleene Star (`r*`):** Denotes zero or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recursive Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitive Regular Expressions\n",
    "- **Empty Set (`∅`):** Represents the language containing no strings.\n",
    "- **Empty String (`λ`):** Represents the language containing only the empty string.\n",
    "- **Atomic Symbol (`α`):** Represents a single character from the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations\n",
    "- **Union (`r1 + r2`):** Represents the union of two languages.\n",
    "- **Concatenation (`r1 r2`):** Represents the concatenation of two languages.\n",
    "- **Kleene Star (`r*`):** Represents zero or more repetitions of a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "- Regular Expression: `(a + b) * a*`\n",
    "- Language: All strings with any combination of `a` and `b`, followed by zero or more `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "- Regular Expression: `(a + b*) * (c + ∅)`\n",
    "- Language: All strings with any combination of `a` and zero or more `b`, followed by either `c` or the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Languages of Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "- For a regular expression `r`, the language `L(r)` is the set of all strings that can be generated by `r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- For the regular expression `(a + b * c)*`, `L((a + b * c)*)` is the set of all strings over `{a, b, c}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conversion from Finite Automaton (FA) to Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalized Transition Graph\n",
    "- Represents the transitions of a finite automaton.\n",
    "- The final regular expression is obtained by combining the regular expressions associated with the transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- Transition graph with states `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, `q4`, and transitions labeled with regular expressions.\n",
    "- The final regular expression `r` is obtained by combining the expressions associated with transitions.\n"
