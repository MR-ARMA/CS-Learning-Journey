# 🎓 Compiler Design Course Pamphlets 📚

Welcome to the repository for the Compiler Design Course Pamphlets! 🎉

This repository contains a collection of pamphlets that I've created to help others understand some of the fundamental concepts in compiler design. I've taken the time to edit and rewrite these pamphlets in a more friendly and engaging way, making them easier to understand and more approachable to beginners. 📝

## 📖 Table of Contents

9. [Types of Grammar](./Handout/09_Types-of-Grammar.ipynb)

## 📚 Course Topics

These pamphlets cover a wide range of topics in compiler design, including:

- Syntax analyzers and their role in validating the syntax of source code.
- The prerequisites for syntax analysis and the limitations of regular expressions.
- Non-context-free language constructs and their implications.
- The scope of syntax analysis and how it relates to semantic analysis.
- The use of context-free grammars in programming languages.
