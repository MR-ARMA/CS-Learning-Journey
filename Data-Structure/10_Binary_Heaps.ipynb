    "**Idea:**\n",
    "One of the clever tricks in data structures is interpreting an array as a complete binary tree. This method helps us manage data efficiently, and it's particularly handy when dealing with heaps and sorting algorithms. Here's a straightforward way to visualize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At each level 'i' of the tree, there can be a maximum of 2^i nodes. This property ensures that the tree remains complete.\n",
    "- The largest depth of the tree (the level with the farthest nodes) may not be completely filled, but all the nodes at that depth are aligned to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a visual representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "d0          ______O____\n",
    "d1      ____O____   __O__\n",
    "d2   __O__    __O  O    O\n",
    "d3  O    O   O\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a complete tree is densely filled from top to bottom, left to right, just like reading a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perspective:**\n",
    "Think of it as a mapping (bijection) between arrays and complete binary trees. Each array index corresponds to a node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the array 'Q = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]' and its representation as a complete binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "d0   0              ->                           ______0____\n",
    "d1   1  2           ->                      ____1____    __2__\n",
    "d2   3  4  5  6     ->                   __3__    __4   5     6\n",
    "d3   7  8  9        ->                  7    8   9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit Complete Tree:**\n",
    "What's fascinating is that you don't need to store explicit pointers for this tree structure; it can be implicit within an array. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The root of the tree is always at index 0.\n",
    "- You can compute the indices of neighbors (left and right children, parent) using simple arithmetic:\n",
    "  - left(i) = 2i + 1\n",
    "  - right(i) = 2i + 2\n",
    "  - parent(i) = (i - 1) // 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to navigate and manipulate the tree using only array indices. It's a powerful concept used extensively in various algorithms and data structures."

    "**Idea:**\n",
    "Binary heaps are a way of organizing data in a tree-like structure, where the larger elements are placed higher up in the tree, but this property is maintained only locally. This organization makes it easy to access the maximum element quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max-Heap Property:**\n",
    "In a binary heap, at any node `i,` the value at that node, denoted as `Q[i]`, should be greater than or equal to the values of its child nodes, which are typically found at indices `left(i)` and `right(i).` This property is crucial for the heap's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max-Heap is an Array:**\n",
    "A max-heap is often implemented as an array that satisfies the max-heap property at all nodes. This array representation simplifies many operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim:**\n",
    "In a max-heap, every node `i` satisfies the property that its value `Q[i]` is greater than or equal to the values `Q[j]` of all nodes `j` in its subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "This claim can be proven using induction on the depth `d` of the nodes `j` relative to node `i.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base Case (d = 0):\n",
    "  When the depth difference is zero, it means `i` and `j` are the same node. Therefore, `Q[i]` is equal to `Q[j]` or greater (by definition).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inductive Step:\n",
    "  Assume the claim holds for all nodes at depth `d-1,` where `d` is the depth of node `j.` Then, when we move from `j` to its parent, `parent(j),` the depth difference reduces by 1 (d-1 to d-2). By induction, `Q[i] ≥ Q[parent(j)],` and by the max-heap property, `Q[parent(j)] ≥ Q[j].` Combining these inequalities, we get `Q[i] ≥ Q[j].`\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Conclusion:**\n",
    "This claim implies that the maximum item in the max-heap always resides at the root. Understanding these fundamental properties of binary heaps is crucial when working with heaps in algorithms and data structures."

    "\n",
    "parent_index = floor((i-1)/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula works because each node in a binary heap has at most two children, and the children of a node at index i are located at indices 2i+1 and 2i+2. Therefore, the parent of a node at index i can be found by reversing the calculation to find its index from its children's indices."

    "Proximate Sorting: An array of distinct integers is k-proximate if every integer of the array is at most k places away from its place in the array after being sorted, i.e., if the ith integer of the unsorted input array is the jth largest integer contained in the array, then |i − j| ≤ k. In this problem, we will show how to sort a k-proximate array faster than Θ(n log n). Prove that insertion sort (as presented in this class, without any changes) will sort a k-proximate array in O(nk) time. "

    "To prove O(nk), we show that each of the n insertion sort rounds swap an item left by at most O(k). In the original ordering, entries that are ≥ 2k slots apart must already be ordered correctly: indeed, if A[s] > A[t] but t − s ≥ 2k, there is no way to reverse the order of these two items while moving each at most k slots. This means that for each entry A[i] in the original order, fewer than 2k of the items A[0], . . . , A[i − 1] are greater than A[i]. Thus, on round i of insertion sort when A[i] is swapped into place, fewer than 2k swaps are required, so round i requires O(k) time. It’s possible to prove a stronger bound: that ai = A[i] is swapped at most k times in round i (instead of 2k). This is a bit subtle: the final sorted index of ai is at most k slots away from i by the k-proximate assumption, but ai might not move to its final position immediately, but may move past its final sorted position and then be bumped to the right in future rounds. Suppose for contradiction a loop swaps the pth largest item A[i] to the left by more than k to position p0 < i − k, past at least k items larger than A[i]. Since A is k-proximate, i − p ≤ k, i.e. i − k ≤ p, so p0 < p. Thus at least one item less than A[i] must exist to the right of A[i]. Let A[j] be the smallest such item, the qth largest item in sorted order. A[j] is smaller than k + 1 items to the left of A[j], and no item to the right of A[j] is smaller than A[j], so q ≤ j − (k + 1), i.e. j − q ≥ k + 1. But A is k-proximate, so j − q ≤ k, a contradiction. "
