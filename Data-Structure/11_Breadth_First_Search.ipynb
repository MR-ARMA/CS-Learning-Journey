    "A graph, denoted as G = (V, E), is a fundamental mathematical construct composed of two essential components: a set of vertices, often referred to as nodes, represented as V, and a set of edges, symbolized as E. In this framework, each edge within E constitutes a pair of vertices selected from V. The relationship between a vertex and an edge is defined by adjacency or incidence, meaning that a vertex and an edge are considered connected if the edge encompasses the vertex within its structure.\n"

    "When we examine vertices u and v, we encounter the concept of edge directionality. An edge is categorized as directed when its vertex pair is ordered, as exemplified by (u, v). Conversely, an edge is deemed undirected when its vertex pair is unordered, often represented as {u, v}, or sometimes indicated as both (u, v) and (v, u). Within a directed edge, such as e = (u, v), it originates from vertex u (known as the tail of e) and terminates at vertex v (known as the head of e). In this context, e is regarded as an incoming edge for vertex v and an outgoing edge for vertex u. In undirected graphs, each edge serves the dual purpose of being incoming and outgoing. The terms \"in-degree\" and \"out-degree\" are employed to quantify the number of incoming and outgoing edges connected to a vertex v, respectively. Typically, when discussing degree, it implies out-degree, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n"

    "Graphs, as their name suggests, are often depicted graphically. In graphical representations, vertices are visualized as points, while edges are depicted as lines that connect these points. In the case of directed edges, these lines frequently include an arrowhead to denote the direction of the edge, usually located near the edge's head. To illustrate, consider the following examples of a directed graph G1 and an undirected graph G2:\n"

    "In graph theory, a path, denoted as path1, is a sequential arrangement of vertices (v0, . . . , vk) such that for each ordered pair of vertices (vi, vi+1), there exists an outgoing edge in the graph that connects vi to vi+1. The length of a path is defined as the number of edges it contains, which is one less than the number of vertices traversed. A graph earns the label of \"strongly connected\" when it boasts a path connecting every node to every other node within the graph. It's worth noting that every connected undirected graph automatically qualifies as strongly connected since every undirected edge incident to a vertex serves the purpose of both incoming and outgoing connections. In the case of directed graph G1, consisting of two connected components, only one of these components can be classified as strongly connected."

    "In computer science, there are numerous methods for representing a graph in code. The most prevalent approach involves utilizing a Set data structure known as Adj, which maps each vertex `u` to another data structure, `Adj(u)`, storing the adjacent vertices reachable from `u` via a single outgoing edge. This internal data structure is commonly referred to as an \"adjacency list.\" Notably, this representation doesn't explicitly store edge pairs; it exclusively maintains the outgoing neighboring vertices for each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "When vertices are uniquely labeled from `0` to `|V| - 1`, it is customary to house the top-level Set Adj within a direct access array of `length |V|`. Each array slot `i` points to the adjacency list of the vertex labeled `i`. Alternatively, when vertices are not labeled in this manner, a hash table is commonly employed to map each `u ∈ V` to its respective `Adj(u)`. Subsequently, each adjacency list, `Adj(u)`, is typically stored as an unordered array of the outgoing adjacencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following adjacency list representations of `G1` and `G2`. These representations utilize a direct access array for the top-level Set and an array for each adjacency list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency List Representation of G1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A1 = [[1],  # 0\n",
    "     [2],  # 1\n",
    "     [0],  # 2\n",
    "     [4],  # 3\n",
    "     []]   # 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency List Representation of G2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A2 = [[1, 4, 3],  # 0\n",
    "     [0],        # 1\n",
    "     [3],        # 2\n",
    "     [0, 2],     # 3\n",
    "     [0]]        # 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an array for an adjacency list is a suitable data structure when the primary task is iterating over the edges incident to a vertex. This is the case for most algorithms discussed in this class, and therefore, it is our default implementation. Notably, each edge appears in any adjacency list at most twice, resulting in an adjacency list representation implemented using arrays having a size of `Θ(|V| + |E|)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one limitation of this representation is that determining whether a graph contains a specific edge `(u, v)` may necessitate `Ω(|V|)` time, as it requires traversing the array representing the adjacency list of `u` or `v`. To mitigate this issue, one can opt for storing adjacency lists using hash tables instead of regular unsorted arrays. This alternative approach supports edge checking in expected `O(1)` time while still utilizing `Θ(|V| + |E|)` space. Nevertheless, for the purposes of our algorithms, we will assume the simpler unsorted-array-based adjacency list representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide representations of `G1` and `G2` that use hash tables for both the outer Adj Set and the inner adjacency lists `Adj(u)`, employing Python dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency List Representation of G1 (Using Hash Tables):\n",
    "```\n",
    "S1 = {0: {1},    # 0\n",
    "      1: {2},    # 1\n",
    "      2: {0},    # 2\n",
    "      3: {4},    # 3\n",
    "      4: {0}}    # 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency List Representation of G2 (Using Hash Tables):\n",
    "```\n",
    "S2 = {0: {1, 3, 4},  # 0\n",
    "      1: {0},        # 1\n",
    "      2: {3},        # 2\n",
    "      3: {0, 2},     # 3\n",
    "      4: {0}}        # 4\n",
    "```\n",

    "Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with graphs, a common task is to determine the vertices that are reachable from a given starting vertex, denoted as 's.' Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm for achieving this goal. BFS efficiently discovers sets of vertices organized by levels, where each level represents vertices reachable from 's' via a shortest path of a specific length, and these levels are uncovered in increasing order. In essence, it explores the graph layer by layer, starting from 's' and moving outward in terms of shortest path length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with level L0, which consists of only 's' itself because the only vertex reachable from 's' with a path length of 0 is 's' (L0 = {s}). Subsequently, to compute level Li+1, we include every vertex that has an incoming edge from a vertex in level Li, provided that it hasn't already been assigned a level. By computing each level based on the preceding one, we effectively build a growing frontier of vertices, exploring them in accordance with their shortest path length from 's.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll find Python code that implements BFS for a graph represented using index-labeled adjacency lists. This code returns a parent label for each vertex, pointing the way along the shortest path back to 's.' The parent labels collectively form a BFS tree, which contains some shortest path from 's' to every other vertex in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bfs(Adj, s):                         # Adj: adjacency list, s: starting vertex\n",
    "    parent = [None for v in Adj]         # O(V) (use hash if unlabeled)\n",
    "    parent[s] = s                        # O(1) root\n",
    "    level = [[s]]                        # O(1) initialize levels\n",
    "    while 0 < len(level[-1]):            # O(?) last level contains vertices\n",
    "        level.append([])                 # O(1) amortized, make a new level\n",
    "        for u in level[-2]:              # O(?) loop over the last full level\n",
    "            for v in Adj[u]:             # O(Adj[u]) loop over neighbors\n",
    "                if parent[v] is None:    # O(1) parent not yet assigned\n",
    "                    parent[v] = u        # O(1) assign parent from level[-2]\n",
    "                    level[-1].append(v)  # O(1) amortized, add to the border\n",
    "    return parent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's analyze the efficiency of BFS. Specifically, how many times does the inner loop on lines 9–11 execute? A crucial point to note is that a vertex is added to any level at most once in line 11. Consequently, the loop in line 7 processes each vertex 'v' at most once. Within the loop on line 8, we cycle through all outgoing edges from vertex 'v,' which totals deg(v) edges. Therefore, the inner loop is repeated at most O(deg(v)) = O(|E|) times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the parent array returned has a length of |V|, it follows that breadth-first search operates in O(|V| + |E|) time, making it a highly efficient algorithm for exploring graphs and determining reachable vertices."

    "    - For every vertex `u` in `V`, construct two vertices `uE` and `uO` in `V0`, representing reaching the vertex u through an even and odd number of edges, respectively.\n",

    "    - Start a breadth-first search (BFS) on G0 from vertex sE to find the shortest path from sE to tO.\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Because G0 is bipartite between even and odd vertices, even paths from sE will always end at even vertices, and odd paths will end at odd vertices. Therefore, finding a shortest path from sE to tO will represent a path of odd length in the original graph.\n",
