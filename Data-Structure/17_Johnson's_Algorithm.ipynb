    "We’ve learned four algorithms to solve the single source shortest paths (SSSP) problem; they are listed in the table below. Then, to solve shortest paths problems, you must first define or construct a graph related to your problem, and then running an SSSP algorithm on that graph in a way that solves your problem. Generally, you will want to use the fastest SSSP algorithm that solves your problem. Bellman-Ford applies to any weighted graph but is the slowest of the four, so we prefer the other algorithms whenever they are applicable. "

    "In the Weighted All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, we are tasked with finding the minimum weight δ(u, v) for every pair of vertices u, v ∈ V in a weighted graph G = (V, E, w). However, if G contains a negative weight cycle, our algorithm is not required to provide an output.\n",

    "A common approach to tackle this problem is to reduce it to solving a Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem |V| times, once from each vertex in V. This method works efficiently for specific graph types. For example, in unweighted sparse graphs (where |E| = O(|V|)), employing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each vertex takes O(|V|^2) time. Since any APSP algorithm must take at least Ω(V^2) time to compute δ(u, v) for all pairs of vertices, this algorithm is optimal for unweighted and sparse graphs.\n",

    "However, for general graphs that may contain negative-weight edges, applying the Bellman-Ford algorithm |V| times can be slow, with a time complexity of O(|V|^2|E|), which is a factor of |E| larger than the output. Conversely, if the graph consists solely of non-negative edge weights, applying Dijkstra's algorithm |V| times results in a time complexity of O(|V|^2 log |V| + |V||E|). In the case of sparse graphs, running Dijkstra |V| times is only logarithmically larger than the output, whereas running Bellman-Ford |V| times is linearly larger.\n",

    "Johnson’s Algorithm offers a clever approach to addressing the All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem in a graph with ***arbitrary edge weights***. It achieves this by transforming the problem into an APSP problem on a graph with non-negative edge weights. This transformation involves re-weighting the edges in the original graph in such a way that the shortest paths in the newly weighted graph are also shortest paths in the original graph. By subsequently applying Dijkstra's algorithm |V| times to find shortest paths in the re-weighted graph, the algorithm effectively solves the original APSP problem.\n",
