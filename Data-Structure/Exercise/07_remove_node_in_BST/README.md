# Binary Search Tree Deletion in C++

This repository contains a C++ program that implements the deletion operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The program provides a function to remove an element from a BST based on its key.

## Features

- Insertion of nodes in the BST
- Deletion of nodes from the BST
- Inorder traversal of the BST

## Usage

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can compile the program by typing `g++ bst.cpp -o bst` in the terminal.
4. Run the compiled program by typing `./bst` in the terminal.

The program will prompt you to enter a series of commands. Here are the valid commands:

- `i`: Insert a new node in the BST. The program will ask you to enter the key of the new node.
- `d`: Delete a node from the BST. The program will ask you to enter the key of the node to be deleted.
- `p`: Print the inorder traversal of the BST.
