# Recursive Combination Calculator

This C++ program calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of r elements from a distinct set of n elements using a recursive function for combinations (nCr).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recursive-combination-calculator.git
   cd recursive-combination-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   g++ combination.cpp -o combination
   ./combination
   ```

3. **Enter Values:**
   - Enter the value of n (number of distinct elements).
   - Enter the value of r (number of elements to choose in each subset).

4. **Output:**
   - The program will display the number of ways to choose a subset of r elements from a set of n elements.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
- The program checks if the input is valid (n >= r) and handles such cases appropriately.
