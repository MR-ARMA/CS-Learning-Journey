# Knight's Tour Program

This C++ program solves the Knight's Tour problem on a chessboard. The Knight's Tour is a classic chess problem where the objective is to find a sequence of moves for a knight to visit every square on the chessboard exactly once.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/knights-tour.git
   cd knights-tour
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   g++ knights_tour.cpp -o knights_tour
   ./knights_tour
   ```

3. **Enter Starting Position:**
   - Enter the starting position for the knight in the format "x y" when prompted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program will display the Knight's Tour if a solution exists, or indicate that no solution was found.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
- The knight follows chess rules, moving in an "L" shape.
- The program uses backtracking to explore different moves and find a valid solution.
