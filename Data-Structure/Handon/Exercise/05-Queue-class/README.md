# Queue Class Implementation in C++

This C++ program provides a simple implementation of a queue using the `std::queue` container. The `Queue` class includes basic queue operations, making it a reusable and versatile component in C++ programs.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/queue-class.git
   cd queue-class
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   g++ queue_class.cpp -o queue_class
   ./queue_class
   ```

3. **Example Usage:**
   - The program demonstrates the usage of the `Queue` class with integer elements.
   - Operations such as enqueue, dequeue, front retrieval, and display are showcased in the `main` function.

## Functions in the Queue Class

1. **isEmpty:**
   - Checks if the queue is empty.

2. **size:**
   - Returns the size of the queue.

3. **enqueue:**
   - Enqueues (pushes) an element to the back of the queue.

4. **dequeue:**
   - Dequeues (pops) the front element from the queue.

5. **front:**
   - Retrieves the front element of the queue without removing it.

6. **display:**
   - Displays the elements of the queue.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
- The program uses a template for generic element types.
