    "In our previous discussion, we explored binary trees as versatile data structures for storing items, allowing us to organize data without imposing constraints on the tree's maximum height. Our ultimate objective is to maintain a state of balance within our tree. A tree containing 'n' nodes is considered balanced when its height is within the bounds of `O(log n)`. This balance ensures that operations, such as those discussed in our previous conversation, which took `O(h)` time, will now only require `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this balance in the face of insertions and deletions, various techniques have been developed, including ***Red-Black Trees***, ***B-Trees***, ***2-3 Trees***, and ***Splay Trees***. One of the oldest and simplest methods, known as the **AVL Tree** (Adelson-Velsky and Landis, 1962), offers an elegant solution. In an AVL Tree, each node is height-balanced, adhering to what we call the AVL Property. This property stipulates that the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of a height-balanced node must not exceed 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it differently, we can determine a node's balance by calculating its skew, defined as the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree (with the height of an empty subtree considered as -1). A node is considered height-balanced if its skew is either -1, 0, or 1. When every node in a tree satisfies this height-balance criterion, we can confidently say that the tree itself is height-balanced.\n"
