# Welcome to my Computer Science Learning Repository! 👋

This repository is my personal collection of the concepts and materials I learn from Computer Science. I've put these materials together in the form of Jupyter Notebook files so that those who want to read and learn can do so at their own pace.

## Contents 📚

The repository contains a wide range of topics from basic to advanced concepts in Computer Science. Each topic is covered in a separate Jupyter Notebook file for easy reading and understanding. Here are some of the topics covered:

- **Algorithms**: A collection of different algorithms explained with code examples.
- **Data Structures**: Detailed explanations and code implementations of various data structures.
- **Operating Systems**: Concepts and principles of operating systems.
- **Computer Networks**: Basics of networking and advanced networking topics.

## How to Use this Repository 🚀

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the repository.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file you're interested in.
4. Read through the material and run the code cells to see the output.

Remember, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed to open the `.ipynb` files. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by following the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install.html).
